# Slow Cooker Turkey Meatballs

Slow Cooker Italian-Style Turkey Meatballs from Dara of Chick in the Kitchen - Note: I use a 6-quart crock pot

### Ingredients
* 2 lbs lean ground turkey
* 1-2 egg(s)
* 1/4 c. fine, plain dry gluten free breadcrumbs
* 1/3 c. fresh parsley, finely chopped
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1/2 tsp. dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* ground black pepper to taste (about 6 turns of the grinder)
* 1 26-oz. jar of your favorite marinara sauce

### Directions
1. Add all ingredients — except for the sauce — to a large bowl, and mix with your hands until well-combined.
2. Roll meat into golf ball-sized balls, and layer into the bottom of your slow cooker. (2 lbs. of meat makes about 28 meatballs, and not quite 2 layers of meatballs in my 6-quart crock pot.)
3. Pour the jar of sauce over the meatballs so they are completely covered.
4. Place lid on your slow cooker and cook on LOW for 4 hours, or HIGH for 3 hours.
