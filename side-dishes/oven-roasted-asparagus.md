# [AB] Roasted Asparagus

### Ingredients
* 1 pound fresh asparagus, 1 to 1 1/2 inches cut off the bottom
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 medium lemon, zested
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
* Freshly ground black pepper

### Directions
1. Heat the oven to 500 degrees F.
2. Lay the asparagus on a long double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Drizzle with the olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the spears into a single layer. Fold the edges of the foil to make a tray.
3. Roast in the oven for 5 minutes.
4. Carefully toss the spears with tongs and roast just until tender and tips begin to brown, about 5 minutes more.
5. Removce from oven. Sprinkle with the zest, salt, nutmeg, and pepper, to taste, and toss to evenly distribute. 
6. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.
