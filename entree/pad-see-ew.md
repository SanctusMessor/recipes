### Ingredients
#### Noodles
* 8oz/200g rice stick noodles, or fresh Sen Yai Noodles if you can get them
#### Sauce
* 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce or kecap manis (see notes for substitutes)
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons white vinegar
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 2 tbsp water
#### Stir Fry
* 2 tbsp peanut or vegetable oil
* 2 cloves garlic cloves
* 1 cup chicken thighs (boneless, skinless), cut into bite size pieces
* 1 large egg
* 4 cups (packed) Chinese broccoli, leaves separated from stems (cut stems vertically into thin sticks)

### Directions
1. Prepare the noodles according to packet instructions. Some just require soaking in boiling water for 5 minutes, others require cooking in a pot of boiling water for a few minutes. Drain when ready.
2. Meanwhile, combine sauce ingredients.
3. Mince the garlic straight into the wok with the oil. Place wok high heat. As the oil is heating, the garlic will gradually heat too and infuse the oil with flavour.
4. When the oil is hot and the garlic is starting to turn golden, add the chicken and Chinese broccoli stems and stir fry for 1 minute.
5. Move the chicken and Chinese broccoli to one side and crack in the egg, and scramble it. Don't worry if some of it sticks to the wok, it will char as you continue cooking - you want that chargrilled flavour!
6. Add the noodles, Chinese broccoli leaves and the sauce. Fold gently to combine, for the sauce to coat the noodles evenly and to caramelise, and the leaves to just wilt. They only need to be just wilted because they will continue to cook while you are plating up.
7. Serve immediately.

### Notes
1. Dark soy sauce is thicker and sweeter than normal soy sauce, and has a more complex flavour. It is available in Asian grocery stores and in the asian section of most large supermarkets. A great substitute is kecap manis which is an Indonesian sweet soy sauce. Otherwise, to make your own substitute, use 1½ tbsp soy sauce with 1 tbsp honey instead of 2 tbsp sweet soy sauce.
 
2. If you can't find Chinese broccoli, you can substitute with other leafy Chinese vegetables such as pak choy or bok choy. You can also add other vegetables if you wish.
 
3. You can substitute the chicken with other proteins suitable for stir frying, even tofu or prawns.
 
4. You can use other noodles if you want, fresh or dried, rice or egg noodles. However, I do not recommend using vermicelli as it is too thin for the strong flavours of the sauce.
 
5. If you accidentally add the noodles into the pan before checking they are properly rehydrated, simply add ½ cup of water to the pan and bring it boil, tossing the noodles to finish "cooking" them. It won't take long because rice noodles do not require much cooking - maybe 1 minute or so, and the dish will still come out fine (though if you already added the broccoli leaves then they will be very wilted rather than just slightly wilted).
