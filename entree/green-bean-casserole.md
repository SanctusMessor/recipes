2. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F, and coat a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray.
3. Combine onions, flour, panko, and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Spread  the onions evenly onto the coated sheet pan, and then place the pan on the middle rack of the preheated oven and bake until golen brown, tossing 2-3 times during cooking; approximately 30mins. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Turn oven down to 400 degrees F.
4. While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5mins. Immediately after blanching plungle the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.
5. Melt the butter in as 12-inch cast iron skillet, set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid; approximately 4-5mins. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1-2mins. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1min. Add the broth and simmer for 1min. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally; approximately 6-8mins.
6. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions.
7. Place into the oven and bake until bubbly, approximately 15mins. Remove and serve immediately.
