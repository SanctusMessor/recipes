# Chicken Fingers
Makes 4 servings
 
### INGREDIENTS:
* 1 bag Enjoy Life Foods Garlic & Parmesan Plentils®
* 1 T. garlic salt
* ½ C. tapioca starch
* 1 C. warm water
* 2 T. ground flaxseeds
* 1 lb. chicken tenders
 
### DIRECTIONS:
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 400°.
2. Pour the Plentils and garlic salt into a small food processor. Pulse until finely ground. Pour into a bowl.
3. Pour the tapioca starch into another bowl. Pour the warm water into another bowl and add the flaxseeds.
4. Arrange the bowls left to right, starting with the flour, then water, and then ground Plentils. One at a time, coat the chicken in the flour, then quickly dip in the warm water, shake off extra water gently, then coat with the Plentils mixture.
5. Lay on the parchment lined baking sheet. Continue in this manner until all chicken tenders are coated.
6. To create the “monster nails”: gently insert the tip of a small, sharp knife into the more tapered end of the chicken tenders, just until you are about ¼ inch deep. Insert pumpkin seed into slit. Continue with remaining chicken pieces.
7. Place in oven and cook at 400° degrees for 14-16 minutes until cooked through.

### NOTES:
1. When substituting cornstarch for tapioca, the proportion is one tablespoon of cornstarch per two tapioca tablespoons.
