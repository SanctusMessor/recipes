### INGREDIENTS
* Greek extra virgin olive oil
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 1/2 lb ground beef
* salt + pepper
* 1/2 tsp allspice
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 cup cooked or canned chickpeas
* 1/2 cup chopped parsley, more for garnish
* 1 cup short grain rice, soaked in water for 10-15 minutes, drained
* 1/2 tsp hot or sweet paprika
* 3 tbsp tomato sauce
* 2 1/4 cup water
* 6 bell peppers, any colors, tops removed, cored
* 3/4 cup chicken broth (or water)
 
### INSTRUCTIONS
1. In a medium heavy pot, heat 1 tbsp of oil. Saute the chopped onions until golden. Now add the meat and cook on medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until deeply browned. Season with salt, pepper, allspice and garlic powder. Stir in the chickpeas and cook briefly.
2. To the same pot, now add the parsley, rice, paprika and tomato sauce; stir to combine. Add the water and bring to a high simmer until liquid has reduced by one half.
3. Turn the heat to low. Cover and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and no longer hard nor too chewy.
4. While the rice is cooking, heat a gas grill to medium-high. Grill the bell peppers for 10-15 minutes, covered. Be sure to turn the peppers occasionally so that all sides get charred. Remove from the grill and let cool briefly.
5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
6. Assemble the bell peppers, open-side up, in a baking dish filled with 3/4 cup broth or water. Spoon in the cooked rice mixture to stuff each of the peppers to the very top.
7. Cover the baking dish tightly with foil and place it in the 350 degree F heated oven. Bake for 20-30 minutes.
