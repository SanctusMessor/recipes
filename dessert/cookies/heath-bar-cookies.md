# Heath Bar Cookies

### Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 cups chopped Heath Bar pieces (8 1/4 oz bars or 11.2 oz)
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts


### Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Set aside. In a separate bowl, combine Heath Bar pieces and chopped walnuts. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, brown and white sugars, and vanilla. Beat in the eggs one at a time.
3. Add the flour mixture a third at a time, beating after each addition. Beat in the Heath Bar walnut mixture. Chill cookie dough for at least 30 minutes (better an hour or longer).
4. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. On cookie sheets lined with parchment paper, spoon out the cookie dough in small 1-inch diameter balls. Place dough balls 3 inches away from each other.
5. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are just starting to brown. Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
